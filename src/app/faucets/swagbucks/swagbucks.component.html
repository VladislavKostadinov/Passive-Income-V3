        "Members of this free rewards service get free gift cards or cash for 
        the everyday activities they're already completing online like searching the web, playing games, watching videos, 
        or shopping online where you'll make money through cash back rebates. There are a number of different ways to earn 
        Swagbucks rewards or SB points that you can easily redeem for Amazon gift cards, PayPal, and other gift cards and 
        great prizes. You'll earn rewards in points, called SB, and you can redeem your points for gift cards or 
        cash. Its 100 SB points for $1 USD in rewards.

    <h4>My point of view</h4>
    <p class="mStatement">
        "<i class="emp">Swagbucks</i> is a very popular platform, in which you can earn cash or gift cards by doing simple 
        tasks, which don't require much skill. In regards to the other side-hustles, I've reviewed, this one has a bigger 
        pay rate in my point of view. You can do surveys (but with surveys it is a bit tricky - you need to qualify for 
        their interest groups), you can play mobile games (with pretty nice rewards), you can complete offers 
        (like sign-ups, etc). You can also install their SwagButton, a browser extension, which provides notifications, 
        when you are on a website with Sales, Coupons and Cash Back Offers. <br>
        In my point of view, it is a very nice platform, in which you can earn some passive 
        income by having fun.

            My personal experience with <i class="emp">SwagBucks</i> is quite positive. I tried a few mobile games and got 
            some SB points (100 points = 1$), but couldn't reach the minimum withdrawal of 10$. It seemed to me too high and 
            required a lot of effort playing small android games. But then I saw a special offer. It was also a mobile game, 
            but payed 800 SB if you reach a certain level for a certain time. The game was actually fun (Monopoly GO) and I 
            managed to collect the rewards I was aiming for, thus reaching the minimum withdrawal. I received my money in 
            PayPal successfully. So, I recommend always checking the special offers. They pay very well.
