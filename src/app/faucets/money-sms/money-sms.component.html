  <h4>Company's statement</h4>
  <p class="cStatement">
    "Our application is exclusively <i class="emp">Android-based</i> because
    only Android allows apps to access SMS.
    <br />
    You only need to install our app on your mobile phone and you will get paid
    just for <i class="emp">receiving SMS</i> text messages.
    <br />

    Our app does not read any of your private messages or use any other data. We
    can access only our own test SMS.
    <br />

    You earn money with the app passively, without any active actions required
    from your side.
    <br />

    You can refer our app to your friends and community and earn 30% from their
    earnings.
    <br />

    Our app is <i class="emp">completely free</i>. You do not need to pay
    anything to get started and there are no hidden fees.
    <br />
    The reason you get payed for receiving SMS is that a lot of Telecom SMS
    providers and Mobile Network Operators need to send SMS test messages to
    foreign countries to verify and ensure proper delivery of their SMS routes.
    You actually get paid because we use your phone number to provide such
    testing services.

  <h4>My point of view</h4>
  <p class="mStatement">
    "When I gave <i class="emp">Money SMS</i> a try, I was a bit sceptical. The
    main reason for this is because I did not expect to earn any significant
    amount of money by free activity. But in the long term, the app is not bad
    at all. It requires zero effort, except maybe clearing out some messages of
    the screen of your mobile phone and cleaning the storage, if they start to
    pile up. You'd receive <i class="emp">0.02$ per SMS</i> and after a while,
    you'd reach the <i class="emp">min. withdrawal of 2$</i>, which you can
    receive in your <i class="emp">PayPal</i> with zero fees. In contrast with
    many risky and low-paying apps out there, it is not a bad side-hustle. The
    only requirement is that you have an
    <i class="emp">Android mobile devide</i>. SMS frequency may depend on your
    location. Here, in Bulgaria, I receive a few SMS per day, sometimes more. If
    you register with my referral code - <i class="emp">1TEZDSTE</i>, you will
    receive a <i class="emp">0.25$ bonus</i> and help me a lot as well."

          elements in it. While you are at the website, you can browse a bit and

          you can proceed to registering and using it.

      I've been able to withdraw once (2$) and have collected another 1.98$ at
      the moment, I am writing this article. I need just one more SMS to be able
      to withraw again, but let's say I've collected twice for a total of 4$.
      The best thing about the app is that requires no attention. The only thing
      you need to do is clear the notifications and storage (if the messages get
      too much). The messages are usually some verifications codes for Google,
      Telegram or other services, that require SMS verification. The app seems
      pretty legit.
