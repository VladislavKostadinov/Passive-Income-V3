    <h4>My point of view</h4>
    <p class="mStatement">
        "<i class="emp">Fire Faucet</i> is a nice side-hustle. It doesn't pay much, at first glance, but in contrast to other faucets, it is 
        one of the best, I've found. It also provides a very nice loyalty system, which increases your earn rate.
        In this platform, you can complete some daily tasks and generate some crypto currencies with the <i class="emp">
            Auto Claim
        </i>functionality. You can then use the earned amount to invest in some projects and get your passive income going.
        I tried that, and it works. Doesn't pay much, but with a lit of patience and perseverance, you can get the 
        foundation you need. You can also continue using <i class="emp">Fire Faucet</i>, because it is addicting and gives 
        out a small amount of free crypto every day.

                *The faucet claim is available every 30 minutes and gives a random amount of 
                <i class="emp">Action Points</i>, between 25-70(I am not completely sure). You can get them every 30 
                minutes, after you complete a short captcha, to prove you are not a bot. There is also a Daily Bonus, 
                which you can get once per day (~60-150 ACP).

            <p><i>**Shortlinks are tedeous and require more time and patience than normal ads,

            <p><i>***The <i class="emp">Daily Tasks</i> is a list of tasks, which can be completed every day. Each taks 
                gives a nice bonus and the list is refreshed daily. If all of them are completed, 
                they provide a nice boost to your 
                daily income and that is why I limit my daily activity to completing all the tasks and activating the 
                <i class="emp">Auto Faucet</i>. This way I don't waste much time and still get a sufficient return rate.

             different crypto currencies at the same time. And don't worry, you can then exchange all your crypto to a

            Fire Faucet is completely free, and even though it requires a certain amount of effort daily, 
            it can actually be quite fun. There's also a chat, in which you can communicate with you fellow earners,
             ask question, or just have fun. Don't advertise, though, and don't ask questions before checking in 
             the FAQ section. The interface is friendly and moderators are cool. And it really pays for the effort. Just 
             not that much. But if you decide to start on your crypto journey towards passive income, it is a very good 
             spot to begin from and I highly recommend it. If you find referrals, though, your income might jump 
             significantly, as you gain 20% of their earnings in the platform.

            Good luck!
