    <h4>My point of view</h4>
    <p class="mStatement">
        "<i class="emp">Fire Faucet</i> is a nice side-hustle. It doesn't pay much, at first glance, but in contrast to other faucets, it is 
        one of the best, I've found. It also provides a very nice loyalty system, which increases your earn rate.
        In this platform, you can complete some daily tasks and generate some crypto currencies with the <i class="emp">
            Auto Claim
        </i>functionality. You can then use the earned amount to invest in some projects and get your passive income going.
        I tried that, and it works. Doesn't pay much, but with a lit of patience and perseverance, you can get the 
        foundation you need. You can also continue using <i class="emp">Fire Faucet</i>, because it is addicting and gives 
        out a small amount of free crypto every day.

            As I already mentioned, Honeygain is completely free. Once you install it, you need only open the Lucky Pot 
            once per day (and it is not even neccessary). All you need to do is collect 20$, and you can withdraw. 
            Depending on your network, referrals, number of devices and luck, you can actually make a decent passive 
            income from this project. I, for instance, am depending mainly on my two devices - mobile and lap-top. And 
            have still managed to withdraw once. <br>
            Good luck!
