        <p class="briefing"><i>Generating passive income is not as easy as it seems. Especially when you start from zero. But, 
            indeed, this option is possible in the World Wide Web. You can start with 0 capital and you can build up a passive income to 
            sustain yourself daily. You only need a PC/lap-top, internet connection and electricity. I tried that, and found some 
            interesting perspectives, as well as some obstacles and a lot of fraud. But there is always a way.

                        Hello, and welcome to my personal page on passive income. My name is Vladislav, and I am from Bulgaria. Some time
                        ago I decided to give passive income a chance. I had recently quit my job for personal reasons and had no income.
                        I've heard that you can gain some passive income by playing games, doing surveys, viewing ads, but I already knew 
                        they provided very limited rewards. Still, I decided to give it a try, with the idea that I would invest my 
                        winnings in other platforms, which generate passive income. There are a lot of investment platforms, but a huge 
                        amount of them are Scam. They trick people by various means to steal their money. I was scammed a few times, but 
                        gained valuable experience and became more careful. Because you can easily get carried away by the promises of 
                        quick winnings and big income. It is not that simple, whatever the scammers try to convince you. It is hard and 
                        requires certain skills and mindset, as well as luck. I have been investing for a about an year and decided to 
                        create this blog, my personal page, where I can share my experience, some insights and even some projects, that I 
                        found and generate crypto coins from. I don't know how long will these projects last, but for now, they are doing 
                        great and I am happy with them. Feel welcome to browse my blog, leave a comment or contact me via telegram /
                        facebook to share some investment ideas and experience. And remember, I am not a financial adviser. I am just 
                        going to share my experience and honest opinion about some projects and passive income as a whole. I am not an 
                        expert as well, but I do think that the information, I am going to provide might be useful for people, who are 
                        just starting, or to people with my level of experience. The blog will evolve with time and include more materials 
                        and information. Please, invest on your own risk, I do not own any of the projects you will find here.

            In this blog I will share some of my experience, during the last year, regarding passive income online, 
            different types of projects and platforms, in which you can earn some money (most of the time in the form of 
            crypto currency). I will also share my current daily income (which is not much) and make a presentation about the 
            projects I trust the most. I welcome comments in the sections of the different projects, I will write about and 
            analyze. You can also find some guides here and stories, but please, bare in mind, that these projects hold some 
            risk (sometimes signigicant). Still, if you are familiar with how these platforms work, you already know that. 
            If you are a novice and want to start earning some crypto, here you can find some information on how I started my journey. 
            In the blog you can find information mainly on three sources of passive income - faucets (and similar), cloud mining platforms 
            and investments (some of which carry the characteristics of HYIP). The last ones (potential HYIP), 
            I believe to hold the most risk. I will 
            include 'Staking' section soon as well. If you have questions or want to connect with me, you can use the Telegram and 
            Facebooks links, I will provide at the end of this page.

        <p class="blogInfo">
            Almost all of the projects, I will discuss here, are dangerous and you can lose your investment. I can't guarantee the safety of 
            your funds. I do not own these projects, but rather participate in them. Still, I will share these ones, that I find interesting. 
            I've returned my investment from them and have started earning net value. Most of the platforms, I will discuss here are highly 
            volatile and provide big ROI(Retun-of-investment), much larger than the one, provided by your local banks. 
            I started my journey from scratch - 0.00$. I used some faucets and played some rewarding games (there are some applications 
            that pay you to play mobile/pc games) and gathered some basic 'resources' (in the form of crypto currency), 
            which I invested in a few places, which seemed safe enough. The ROI is pretty low if you start with 0$, but it is a option, 
            if you have 
            free time and want to put in some effort. You need to collect at least 5$ if you are to invest in a small platform with the idea of 
            generating some passive income (I would suggest atleast 15$). The more $ you invest - the better, but it's better to invest little in 
            long-term platform with lesser 
            ROI, than a high-return platform, which proves to be a scam. Usually, when I see a platform with ROI > 3% per day, I get suspicious.

          <p class="dailyIncomeIntro">My daily passive income is mostly generated thanks to two projects I've invested in (NftFerma and Minelab). 
            I will talk more about them later. I found some other interesting alternatives, but I've not committed large amounts of crypto 
            in them yet. For now, you can see my daily income below, and it is quite helpful for paying taxes, or sponsoring side hobbies. 
            It also has the perspective of generating and holding some crypto with the hope of future rising on the coin's price.
