    <h4>My point of view</h4>
    <p class="mStatement">
        "<i class="emp">Game Of Thrones Mining Simulator </i> seems to me like a promising new platform. It has been 
        registered on 13th of September 2013 (as a domain) and has gained a lot of popularity recently. I am considering 
        investing a medium amount of cryptocurrency, because there a lot of proofs and it is currently paying. But there 
        is risk, because all 
        such platforms are dangerous. It can disappear at any time (I believe it will stay for a while, but I can't be 
        sure). It's ROI is not that high, but is reasonable. You get your investment back in a few months and after that 
        you earn net value. The platform is designed very well, it is beautiful, colorful and dynamic. I really like it. 
        The question here is - is it worth the risk? Will it remain paying for the next few months, so it's investors can 
        return their investment and even earn some extra? I decided to give it a try, because there are a lot of good 
        reviews, pointing out that the creators of the platform have good projects that are still paying. And I kind of 
        like the design and mechanics."

            <p><i>*The registration process is simple and straightforward. After completing it, you will receive a

                commander to generate much. You will receive more from PTC and Offerwalls than him. Still, he is a free bonus and 
                you can also equip him with items, followers, castles and even a dragon and increase him income significantly. 
                To equip him, you would need to invest, though, or collect by the above-mentioned methods, which might prove to be 
                a very slow process.

                your daily ROI. But not immediately. After deposit, you should spend your crypto on 
                buying <i class="emp">new commanders</i> or <i class="emp">equiping</i> your current ones. You can equip items, 
                followers, castles and a dragon to every commander, and the price of these 'equipments' depend on the 
                <i class="emp">rarity</i> of your commander. Stronger commanders provide more ROI per day, and also have 
                stronger equipment. Every equipment has a <i class="emp">life</i> and disappears, after reaching 200% of its 
                price. Commanders, on the other hand, are permanent. They do not expire. Make sure to 
                <i class="emp">collect your commander's ROI</i> every day, or the miner will stop after 24h, unless you collect it.

            <p><i>***There are other sources of passive income in this platform, like <i class="emp">PTC</i>, 
                <i class="emp">OfferWalls</i> and <i class="emp">Quests</i>. I believe they are included, because the creators have 
                other projects, which have these options and decided to include them in their new one as well. Very good.

          in a dangerous field of operations - cloud mining and crypto investments. Still, I believe is it one of the good
