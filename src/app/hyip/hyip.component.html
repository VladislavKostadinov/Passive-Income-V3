                The type of online investments I am going to present here hold some signigicant risk, and bare some 
                charecteristics of <i class="warning">HYIP (High Yield Investment Programs)</i>. Quite frankly, 
                I was kind of reluctant investing 
                in any of them, but with time, I actually decided to invest in a few. They are many different types of investment 
                platforms out there. Sometimes you can find yourself investing in gold, oil, real estate, forex trading or even 
                medicinal cannabis.
                There a <i class="warning">A LOT of scams</i>, so be weary. Such projects try their best to assure you they are legit, while beeing
                a total fraud. The ones, I usually invest in are mainly traders. And I also tend to play safe and restrain 
                my greed, when I see big ROIs such as > 5%.

               Investing online holds great risk. A huge number of projects are <i class="underWarning">scam or fraud</i>.
                I have been scammed a few times and lost around 300$. But thanks to that experience, I've started investing 
                strategically and only after I make a thorough research of the platform, I have interest in. Also, when you've
                seen a lot of scam projects, you start recognizing them early on. One of the major rules in this area of online 
                business is <i class="underWarning">"Invest only what you can afford to lose</i>. I totally agree - you must 
                definitely not give in to your greed, because even if there is a chance to win big, there is an even bigger chance for 
                you to get scammed. I recommend slow and steady investment in strategic moments of the platforms life-cycle.

                I've come accross many investment platforms, and I admit - most of them are scam. But if you are trying to make some 
                passive income, without a big capital in your disposal, you already know, you're getting yourself into the scammers`
                territory. They offer huge return rates, but after a while you start discerning decent from fraudulent platforms. 
                There is always the risk-factor. The moment, when you are considering investing in some of these websites, but are not 
                very sure it is a good idea. In these cases, I recommend trusting your gut. If you feel uncomfortable and pressured 
                from the idea of investing - don't rush it. Take a few days and think carefully about it. <br>
                The platforms I am going to present to you today have been tested by me. They are currently paying, but I can 
                not guarantee for how long. I can just provide some insight and how I feel about them. <br>
                Please, invest on your own risk (and check the full review with the <i class="warning">"Explore"</i> button).

        <h3>Things you should keep in mind, when you encounter such projects:</h3>
        <ul class="iTips">
            <li>Scammers will try everything to lure you into investing in their platform.</li>
            <li>Sometimes the platforms pay only 2 or 3 times, beforing finding a problem with your account.</li>
            <li>Some platforms suddenly dissapear, without notice, only to reappear soon after with a new name. 
                (complete restart = all your previous investments gone).
            </li>
            <li>Some platforms have hidden rules, which are not visible at the beginning and tend to trap you 
                in their labyrinth of dispair.
            </li>
